> Example using [speedrun](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speedrun) to start a [pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/).

This demo is a slightly-rehashed version of the [pixi.js hello world](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi/blob/master/examples/01_helloWorld.html) example by Rex van der Spuy ([kittykatattack](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi)).

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This npm start script will execute `speedrun` to create a development environment for working on the demo project. With the start script running have a play with the javascript files to see all the benefits.
